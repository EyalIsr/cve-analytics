[![cicd](https://github.com/EyalIsr/cve-analytics/workflows/cicd/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-analytics/actions/workflows/cicd.yaml)

This project aims to provide an overview of latest software vulnerbilities publicly disclosed; the data is exposed by NVD ([NATIONAL VULNERABILITY DATABASE](https://nvd.nist.gov/)) and I'll be consuming it and analyze some key metrics.

Note: only High and Critical scored vulnerabilities are shown here. 

This product uses data from the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD
